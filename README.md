# Fa-250-Workshop-1

For this workshop I began by replicating the code Leo shows during the instructional video.
I slightly modified it to have 2 circles, one blue, one red, moving horizontally and vertically across the middle of the canvas.

I made the two circles move at different speeds by using two different move variables.

A problem I had with this sketch was making the two circles different colours, to do this I just reset the fill after creating the first circle.

To keep my code tidy, I made the two circles into two different functions which are created and called within the draw function.

I didn't want to spend too much time on one task as I had a lot to catch up on but I do think that the difference in movement between the circles was interesting and I want to implement that asymmetry into my 
future works.
